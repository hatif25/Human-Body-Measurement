# 3D Body Measurement Extraction from Images

Extract accurate body measurements from a single 2D image using computer vision and deep learning.

## Features

- üìè Extract 15+ body measurements (height, waist, chest, etc.)
- üìÅ Output in JSON/CSV format for easy integration
- üñºÔ∏è Processes standard image formats (JPG, PNG)
- ‚ö° Fast inference with pre-trained models

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/body-measurement.git
   cd body-measurement
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the measurement extraction:
```bash
python measure.py --input [image_path] --height [height_in_cm]
```

Example:
```bash
python measure.py --input samples/person.jpg --height 175
```

### Output
The script will generate:
- `measurements.json` containing all body measurements
- Optional: `measurements.csv` for spreadsheet compatibility

## Supported Measurements

| Measurement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Height | Total body height |
| Waist | Waist circumference |
| Chest | Chest circumference |
| Hips | Hip circumference |
| Arm Length | Shoulder to wrist |
| Thigh | Thigh circumference |
| Inseam | Inner leg length |

## Image Requirements

For best results:
- Front-facing full-body photo
- Tight-fitting clothing preferred
- Arms slightly away from body
- Neutral standing pose
- Well-lit environment

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add 3D model visualization
- [ ] Improve pose normalization
- [ ] Support for multiple people in one image
