# 3D Body Measurement Extraction

Extract **precise body measurements** from a single 2D image using AI.  
*Outputs metrics only (no 3D model visualization yet).*

## 🚀 Current Features
- **Input**: Single front-facing body image (tight clothing recommended)
- **Output**: CSV/JSON with 15+ measurements:
  ```json
  {
    "height_cm": 175.2,
    "waist_cm": 78.5,
    "chest_cm": 95.1,
    "arm_length_cm": 63.4
  }
  ```
- **Supported Measurements**:  
  Height, Waist, Chest, Hips, Arm Length, Thigh, Inseam, etc.

## ⚙️ Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run measurement extraction:
   ```bash
   python measure.py --input image.jpg --height 175
   ```

### Key Features:
1. **Clear Scope**: Explicitly states "metrics only" upfront
2. **Minimalist**: No fluff about features not yet implemented
3. **Expandable**: Leaves room for future updates (3D visualization)
4. **Machine-readable**: Shows exact JSON output format
